# Terminology

### Market 
Usually used when your item is worth nothing more than it's price on the Steam Market.

**Usage:** dude ur skin is market
**Meaning:** Your skin is worth just as much as the Steam Market says it is worth.

### Buff

One of the most used terms that you will inevitably come accross.
Buff is a chinese skin marketplace (NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH buff.market), that is very popular amongst traders due to it's low prices - further down below, you will find a whole section about Buff.

**Usage:** i want 90% buff price for this negev skin
**Meaning:** I'm selling this skin for 90% of the price that it's listed on buff for.

### Liquid
A skin / item that is constantly desired and has a stable market price, such as the Ak-47 | Redline or Nametags. You will always be able to sell it quickly, for around the same price.

### Arcana
Arcanas were once used as a liquid item in trading, due to them being a Dota item, they *had* no trade hold, but as of May 2020, they now have a trade hold and are rarely used.

### Overpay
Used when someone offers you skins, that are worth more than your skins.

**Usage:** This guy is offering me a $200 knife for my $190 item.
**Meaning:** This person is overpaying $10 more than my item is worth.

### Lowball
Used when someone offers you skins, that are worth way less than your skins.

**Usage:** You offered me $35 for my $40 item, what a lowball.
**Meaning:** You are offering me $5 less than my item is actually worth.

### Upgrade
Upgrade, is when you trade a lot of cheaper skins, for one more expensive skin. In this scenario, you should be the one overpaying a little.

### Downgrade
Downgrade, is when you trade one expensive skin, for a lot of cheaper skins. In this scenario, the other person, who is trying to upgrade should be overpaying you.

### Tradehold / Tradeban
When a Counter Strike skin is purchased from market, or traded, it cannot be traded again for 7 days, this is what is referred to as a tradelock.

**Usage:** Can't trade yet, my skin is still on a trade hold.
**Meaning:** My skin still has a trade hold on it, because I have gotten it less than 7 days ago.

### Shark / Sharking
Shark, would be a name for a person trying to defraud you, by making you think your skins are worth less than they actually are, or vice versa.

# Trading Template

### Format 
When you post your trade publicly on any website or in our Discord, it is best to keep it neat, formulated and easy to read through. Too much clogged up text is likely to deter other traders.

The generally accepted template to follow is:

**[H]**  - Stands for Have, here you write the skins you have.
**[W]**  - Stands for Want, here you write the skins you want.
**[TL]** - Stands for Tradelink, in here, input your trade link.

### Tradelink

[Your trade link can be found by clicking here, or under the Trade URL section:](https://steamcommunity.com/id/vortexiel/tradeoffers/privacy#trade_offer_access_url)

![enter image description here](https://trademart.gg/guide/assets/img/tradelink.png)

So, if I have an AK-47 Safari Mesh that I'm trying to trade for a AK-47 Elite Build, I would write this:

**[H]**  AK-47 | Safari Mesh
**[W]**  AK-47 | Elite Build
**[TL]** https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=1033395227&token=Mn0cLwhP

### Trading Terminology

**b/o** - Stands for Buy-Out.
Your buy-out price is a price at which you would be willing to let your skin go immediately.


**c/o** - Stands for Current Offer.
The current offer is the highest / best offer someone has offered you for your skin.
By disclaiming your c/o. you signal the person that you won't let your skin go for below that price, and they will have to beat that offer. Faking a c/o is the same as sharking.


**SS** - Stands for Screen-Shot.
Sometimes, it is a good idea to include a screenshot of your skin in your advert.
You should never take pictures of your screen with a phone, it makes you seem very amateur.

# Scams

**After all these years, scammers remain to be one of the greatest threats Counter Strike trading faces.**

It is important for you to have an understanding of at least the most common scamming methods, as falling for any of these is very easy for a beginning trader, resulting in all your progress - and skins lost.

But not only newbies are being targetted, there have been instances of experienced people with $50,000 inventores+ getting scammed.

Be very careful when cash trading, especially if you don't know what you are doing. Ask within our Discord or use one of our reputable cash traders who have completed KYC.

**NEVER SEND YOUR SKINS TO ANYONE, BEFORE RECEIVING WHAT THEY ARE PROMISING.**

If you want to stay safe, we recommend our [Trademart Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trademart-extinction/lnpjmfdnfmaeheajhkamnechgjfjjimp) that warns you of people who have been banned from our Discord server.

Another sign that someone might be attempting to scam you, is trying to pressure you and rush you into a trade without thinking.

We recommend you to always keep all trade-related conversations in form of text, scammers will often call you to arrange a trade, as that way you won't have any screenshots and thus, no proof.

### Cash / PayPal / Code Scams

**This is the most common and easiest way people get scammed.**

In this scam, a person is likely to approach you, and often offer you an amount that is much higher than the amount of your skins' worth.

They will ask you to 'go first', though, after you send them the items there is no payment ever coming back, afterwards they usually block and unfriend you.

If are you looking to cash-out your Counter Strike skins to real money, we recommend using trusted websites as a platform to do so, as they remove 100% of the risk associated.

### Phishing / API scams

# Float Values

Float is a randomly chosen numerical representation of the wear of the skin.

The lower the float value, the cleaner the skin appears.

Float value/wear of a skin is a fixed value, the float value will NEVER change.

Floats range all the way from 0 to 1, although some skins have float caps that prevent their float from going above or below a set value. This is called a "float range".

The float range of an item can be found on: [csgostash.com](https://csgostash.com)

So, let's say you have an AWP | Phobos with float value 0.0631 and an AWP | Phobos with float value 0.3854, as the float of 0.0631 is lower than 0.3854 it will appear cleaner.

**An item's float value also determines the wear of the skin based on where the skins float value falls between 0 and 1.**

| Condition      | Min Value                        | Max Value                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Factory New    | 0.000000000000000000000000000    | 0.06999999284744262695312500     |
| Minimal Wear   | 0.070000000298023223876953125    | 0.14999999105930328369140625     |
| Field-Tested   | 0.150000005960464477539062500    | 0.37999999523162841796875000     |
| Well-Worn      | 0.380000025033950805664062500    | 0.44999998807907104492187500     |
| Battle-Scarred | 0.450000017881393432617187500    | 1.00000000000000000000000000     |

Now, the fact that your skin has a float is nothing special, every single skin has a float value.

**In most cases, the float does not affect the value of the skin at all.**

When it comes to rare floats and float collecting, people want floats that are hard to find.
A float would be desirable in such a case, where it falls close to a minimum or maximum float cap.
For example, an AWP Phobos with float 0.00000x or 0.3999999x.

Since the float range for an AWP Phobos is 0 - 0.4.

Any float in the middle of a float range, such as 0.3634 or 0.1354 float, is not significant at all.

The fact that the float value of a skin, upon its drop, is based on a bell curve, it makes it very rare to get a skin with the highest or lowest float value.
In order to make a profit from such an item, it is good to buy the best or worst of a gun in existence.

So, an AWP Phobos with .3999999 float (considering it caps at 0.4) would be worth more than a random float of 0.28531 or similar.
This is where the monetary value comes into play.
There is only a certain amount of each skin, and each skin has a certain float value.
And each skin is ranked in terms of this float value.

By saying that your skin is the #1 highest float AWP | Phobos in the world, it means that it has the highest float in the world, out of all other AWP | Phobos that exist.

**People will usually not overpay you for a float unless it is within the top 10 highest or lowest floats for that skin.**

But, just to give you an idea, the #1 AWP | Safari Mesh is being offered for 1000$ although the Steam Market price of the skin itself is only about 0.30$.

This is a very special case though, as it is an iconic skin. In general, you can expect much less overpay for ranks 2-5 and a reasonable amount over the market for #1 floats.

If you struggle to sell, you can always lower your price, but you cannot reverse selling something for too cheap. All you will be able to do is regret doing so.

The problem with price-checking high/low floats is that the prices are entirely subjective. The amount you can possibly sell a low/high float skin for is entirely determined by the open market, and not by any formula or rule. The most reliable way to find the price of float-niche items is to study the market firsthand in order to determine the demand of particular floats.

### Float DB

**You can browse and find the world rankings on a website called [db.csgofloat.com](https://db.csgofloat.com)**

Which is, as of now the most reliable website, with the largest float database of all.

They also offer a browser extension, that lets you see floats of your own skins, and of skins on the Steam Market very easily. We personally recommend this as essential to every trader.

![enter image description here](https://trademart.gg/guide/assets/img/float_inventory.png)

### Maths or Science

**Counter Strike’s float values are based on the iEEE 754 Standard which is a decimal system of "real numbers" that computers can interpret.** Within this system there are over 2 billion different float values between 0 and 1 that a skin can have attached to it. Because float values are not randomly generated, but rather randomly chosen from a selection it is possible for a skin to have an identical float value to another skin.

**How do some skins have infinite 0's after a certain point?**

The decimals within the iEEE 754 standard were not randomly chosen.
Instead they are all multiples of 2. **For example:**
2 / 2 = 1
1 / 2 = 0.5
0.5 / 2 = 0.25
0.25 / 2 = 0.125
0.125 / 2 = 0.0625

What this means is that the float values 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.0625 all have infinite 0s after the final digit. If you input the correct average of floats into a trade-up, you can receive a skin resulting into one of these as a result.

What many people do not realize is that, because all float values are multiples of 2, all float values have infinite 0s even if we can not see them when inspecting an item in game.

As we've said, the value of these skins is VERY subjective, and we could polemize about this topic for hours and step into deepest depths of it.

# Stickered Items

Stickers. Not everyone admits it, but everyone loves them.

In Counter Strike, you can purchase and apply stickers to your skins.

Each sticker can be listed, sold on the Steam Market and traded. Or, you can apply that sticker to a skin, with a one-time use. **Upon applying a sticker to a skin, the sticker loses vast majority of its value.**

**After the sticker is applied to a weapon, it cannot be undone.** It can only be scraped. Each time you scrape a sticker, it looks more worn, if you scrape it 10 times, it is removed from the skin forever. Scraping the sticker DOES NOT affect the wear of the skin itself.

If you apply a sticker with a trade-hold on a skin, it adds a 7-day trade-hold to it. If the sticker does not have a trade-hold anymore, it does not add it.

In most cases, applied stickers are seen as completely worthless to other traders, who will refuse to pay anything other than the market price of the skin.

**In some cases, when a sticker is really expensive, it will add value to the skin.** If the sticker is scraped it loses most of its value, if not all.

### Katowice 2014

**Stickers from the Katowice 2014 tournament are the most desired of all, and probably the best to make examples of.** There are many other tournaments and many different stickers from them that are also valuable, but for educational purposes, we will focus on Kato 14's.

**Paper**

### Sticker Placement

**Most weapons have their own best and worst positions.**
Although, whether it is truly the best position, can be subjective to one's own liking, amongst collectors, there usually is an agreed-upon standard.

The best position on a gun is usually the one that is visible the most, no matter the player model.
A bad sticker position is considered to be a place, where the sticker is either covered by the player model while in-game and can be seen only when inspecting, or is really distorted by the bumps on the weapon.

![enter image description here](https://trademart.gg/guide/assets/img/sticker_example1.jpg)
![enter image description here](https://trademart.gg/guide/assets/img/sticker_example2.jpg)
_In this example, the worst position would be the handle, since the sticker is covered by the hand._

The best position would be the one above the handle, as there the sticker is the largest and most visible, even while not inspecting the skin.
The other two spots on the barrel are subjectively second and third best positions.

**The rough rule of thumb is 5% sticker percentage for best position and 0.5% for worst position.**
Sometimes more, sometimes less, it truly depends.

The same percentage does not apply in a case, where we talk about a 4x craft of the same sticker, such as the Glock in the example. With crafts like these, we add up the price of all the stickers together and take a single percentage from that.

When a sticker is a 4x (meaning it has 4 of the same sticker on it) it boosts the value drastically.
This means, that the person who buys it, buys a finished craft and won't have to purchase the additional stickers separately in order to finish it.

**Due to this fact, sticker percentage on these skins can go as high as 60%, if it is a fitting skin, in its best wear and usually featuring stat-trak as well, if possible.**

On some weapons, such as the Negev there isn't really a best or worst position and it comes down either to personal preference, or aesthetics of the symmetrical proportions where the stickers fit.
